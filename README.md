# LaTeX packages

- package for interfacing with inkscape, to be used with [this](https://github.com/johnyf/inkscape).
  This includes both single or multiple figures imported with one command, as well as layered figures for presentations.
- other custom LaTeX convenience commands
- preambles I use for `XeLaTeX` documents and `beamer`
- Caltech beamer theme (courtesy [Scott Livingston](https://github.com/slivingston/misc/tree/master/presentation_templates))
- Greek hyphenation
